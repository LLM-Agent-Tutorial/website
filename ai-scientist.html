            The AI Scientist aims to independently carry out a scientific research process from idea
            generation to paper writing without any human involvement. It produces a research paper in three phases: (1)
            idea generation, (2) experimental iteration, and (3) paper write-up. First, the AI Scientist generate a
            diverse set of ideas that are different from existing literature. Then the AI Scientist executes the
            proposed experiments and visualizes its results during experimental iteration. In paper write-up, it
            produces a concise and informative write-up of its progress in the style of a standard machine learning
            conference in LaTeX. Afterward, an LLM-generated review is introduced to assess the quality of the generated
            paper for the AI Scientist to revise accordingly.

          <figcaption>Conceptual illustration of The AI Scientist, an end-to-end LLM-driven scientific discovery process. The AI Scientist first invents and assesses the novelty of a set of ideas. It then determines how to test the hypotheses, including writing the necessary code by editing a codebase powered by recent advances in automated code generation. Afterward, the experiments are automatically executed to collect a set of results consisting of both numerical scores and visual summaries (e.g. plots or tables). The results are motivated, explained, and summarized in a LaTeX report. Finally, The AI Scientist generates an automated review, according to current practice at standard machine learning conferences. The review can be used to either improve the project or as feedback to future generations for open-ended scientific discovery.

        <p>The sections below unpack how the AI Scientist orchestrates multi-step planning, extensive tool use, and rigorous reflection to produce papers autonomously.</p>

      <section id="ais-planning" class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Planning</h2>
        <p>
          Planning helps the AI Scientist break down a complex goal into smaller, sequential steps. For example, during
          experimental iteration, the AI Scientist plans the experimental steps for each selected idea, writes code and
          conducts experiments according to these plans. In the paper write-up phase, the AI Scientist organizes its
          scientific findings into research papers. Overall, the planning ability helps the AI Scientist organize its
          multi-step research process, allowing it to generate, improve, carry out ideas, and write research papers in a
          clear and purposeful way. We provide an example of how the AI Scientist generates an experimental plan below.

      <section id="ais-tools" class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Tool use</h2>
        <p>
          In all three phases, the AI Scientist extensively leverages tools. During idea generation, the AI Scientist
          evaluates the novelty of ideas by retrieving literature. It prompts an LLM to formulate search queries (such
          as related paper titles or keyword combinations), and then passes these queries to a built-in Python module
          that calls the Semantic Scholar API2 to get related literature. In experimental iteration, to carry out
          experiments, the AI Scientist employs Aider3, a coding assistant. The Aider takes the experimental plan
          generated by the LLM as input and then automatically generates code to execute the plan. In paper write-up,
          after the LLM generates the manuscript in LaTeX format, the AI scientist calls a LaTeX compiler to process the
          tex file and produces the corresponding PDF. The following is an example of generating a literature retrieval
          query.

            <p><strong>Instruction:</strong>&nbsp;You have an idea and you want to check if it is novel. You will be
              given access to the Semantic Scholar API, which you may use to survey the literature and find relevant
              papers to help you make your decision. Please provide a search query to search the literature.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Human scientific research relies heavily on reflection, and the AI Scientist is no exception. When generating
          ideas, the AI Scientist use self-reflection to refine each proposed idea. During experiment iteration, it
          analyzes the experimental results and adjusts methods accordingly. In paper write-up, the AI Scientist perform
          two rounds of self-reflection section-by-section, aiming to improve the accuracy, conciseness, and coherence
          of each section. The most important reflection is based on the Automated Paper Reviewing mechanism. The PDF
          version of the generated paper is converted into text and reviewed by an LLM-based reviewer agent. The review
          feedback is used by the AI Scientist to improve the paper writing. An example for generating review comments
          is as follows.
